        <h2>lizzy 11/1/2023</h2>
        <p>sometimes i wonder why people dislike others for simple things they have or enjoy, like if someone has autism, people will hate them, i mean there's literally an entire group DEDICATED to hating on people with autism. or if someone is in the lgbtq+ community, people can and will hate them too. if theyre a furry, people will hate them. why? no idea. maybe they have no idea of how to be actually thoughtful and polite. everyone in this world has differences, different races, different likes, different opinions, different talents, different everything. some will share them, some wont, and it doesnt really mean that because you dont share those differences, you hate on them and the people who share them. theres really no point, the only thing it does is brings them down, it can cause even as far as mental problems, it can make them lose self-esteem. i have a small self-esteem, and alot of it is from people hating on me, me being paranoid that i will be hated on for the things i do, the differences i have, and more. and another thing kind of similiar to this is that it really sucks when people hate on others for the way they seem, by judging them by their cover. i may seem like a jerk sometimes, but im in fact a really nice, smart person, even if i say otherwise. anyhow i have to stop typing because i gotta go so yeah uh how do i end this uh so yeah uh bye ohuoafisfajoifs</p>
